Udacity Android Nanodegree Project 1 - Popular Movies

In order to compile this app you will need an API key from [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org).
Once you have it create a file called `app/src/main/res/values/api_key.xml`.
It should look like this:

    <resources>
        <string name="api_key">YOUR API KEY</string>
    </resources>

**DO NOT EVER commit this file into a public version control repository!**
